This program uses the output from the web crawler (url.txt and words.txt) for use as a search engine. 

    Usage: search-engine port (array | hash | avl | bsearch) -r
      It starts a search engine at this port using the
      data structure indicated. Port has to be larger than 1024.
      Without the -r flag, only results containing all searched words
      Will be displayed. The -r flag specifies ranked result.
      Search results will be displayed in ranked order.

There are no known bugs with either my webcrawler, search-engine, or any of my dictionaries.
I did not implement AVL remove, however.

I have slightly altered what my webcrawler accepts as a valid "word." onContentFound() adds characters to a word buffere until an escape, period, comma, colon, semicolon, etc. is encountered. At that point, the buffer is checked to ensure that it contains only letters and apostrophes before the word is added.

Including a -r flag after specifying the dictionary type when starting the program will allow all hits for the searched words to display in ranked order, rather than only the pages that contain all of the words.
